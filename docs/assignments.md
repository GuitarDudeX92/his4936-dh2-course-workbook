    - Miriam Posner, ["Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction"](http://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction)
    - Miriam Posner, ["What's Next, The Radical Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities"](http://miriamposner.com/blog/whats-next-the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities)
* On Canvas, submit a one paragraph description of a project you might be interested in pursuing. If you already have a source of data in mind, make sure to include that. If you don't know what you want to research yet, tell me in what subjects you might want to start looking.

## Week 5 - Designing Schema and the Anatomy of a Query
* Head Back to Codecademy
    * EITHER go to the SQL course and complete unit 3, and submit a screenshot
    * OR go to the Python course and complete unit's 6-8, and submit a screenshot
* Locate a real historical source(s) that might serve as fodder for a project
    * Where to Look
        * Special Collections
        * Sources published non-digitally
        * If it is digital already, what can you add?
    * Learn as much as you can about said source(s)
        * When was it produced?
        * How can it be accessed?
        * What are difficulties in turning it digital?
    * **Come to class prepared to talk about how we might explore it.**
