# Setup

### Using your command prompt/terminal

#### Windows Users
On Windows, the terminal is called the command prompt. To access it, click the Start Menu, and start typing 'Command Prompt'. You should see a match pop up, click it to begin.

1. `dir` - (Short for directory) See the contents of the directory you are in
2. `cd foldername` - (Short for change directory) Move to a subfolder named "foldername" inside your current directory (replace foldername with whatever directory you wish)
3. `cd C:\some\sample\with\a_full_path` - Moves directly to the folder specified when you give it an entire path (note that Windows uses backslashes while Mac/Linux uses forward slashes)
3. `cd..`` - Move up one directory, into the parent folder of wherever you are
4. `D:` - Changes to the "D" drive (or whatever drive you specify)

#### Mac/Linux Users
On Mac (OSX), you access the terminal by going to your Applications folder, then to your Utilities subfolder. There you should see a program called Terminal, click it to begin.

1. `ls` - (Short for ls) See the contents of the directory you are in
2. `cd foldername` - (Short for change directory) Move to a subfolder named "foldername" inside your current directory (replace foldername with whatever directory you wish)
3. `cd /some/sample/with/a_full_path` - Moves directly to the folder specified when you give it an entire path (note that Windows uses backslashes while Mac/Linux uses forward slashes)
3. `cd ..`` - Move up one directory, into the parent folder of wherever you are (note that there is a space between "cd" and "..", unlike in Windows systems)

**$ indicates the start of a new command, do not enter it into the terminal/command prompt**
